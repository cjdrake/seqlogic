# Sequential Logic

Sequential Logic (`seqlogic`) is a logic simulation library.
It uses Python's `async` / `await` syntax to model time,
and provides a bit array data type for combinational logic.

The API design is a work in progress, and documentation has not started.
See the `tests` directory for example usage.
